AppImage SAndboxing Project: a Golang library to help sandbox AppImages with bwrap

VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT! Many parts of this are subject to change and should be expected to until it reaches a more stable form

## What is it?

aisap intends to be a simple way to implement Android/Flatpak style sandboxing with AppImages. It does have a partial profile system, but it intends to keep it as basic as possible, thus easier to understand what a program actually requires to run. This is NOT a sandboxing implementation in and of itself, it just helps take simple rules and feeds them into bwrap

It currently has a basic re-implementaion of the go-appimage API, so modifying existing GoLang programs to include sandboxing should be fairly painless

It's intended to be used in other projects, but provides an executable as a basic implementation and example

## Bare bones basics

In order for aisap to sandbox an AppImage, it requires a profile. This can either be provided in aisap's internal profile library, manually specifying the permissions with [`aisap-bin`](#usage-of-aisap-bin), or an extended desktop entry (see example below), which can either be included inside the AppImage, or manually specified with aisap-bin's `--profile` flag.
```
[X-AppImage-Required-Permissions]
Level=2
Files=xdg-documents:rw;
Devices=dri;
Sockets=x11;wayland;
```

The ultimate goal is to have as many popular AppImages in [aisap's internal library](profiles/README.md) as possible, while smaller, less known apps may request their own permssions per the developer by extending the AppImage's desktop entry. Running programs sandboxed should mostly be seamless and feel native with the system

Unfortunately, I've been unable to find a Golang binding for squashfuse, so my current *hacky* workaround is to simply use squashfuse's binary executable, which needs to be in the same directory as any project that uses this library, or installed on the host system. Once I get sandboxing to a more stable state, I fully intend to create a proper binding of squashfuse for Golang, which would certainly benefit more than this project (unless someone else wants to knock that part out ðŸ˜‰)

## Usage of aisap-bin
aisap-bin is a simple command line utility that serves as a proof-of-concept. I created it to demonstrate some basic usage of the API, but I also intend it to eventually be a decent program on its own. It works, and I use it on my system daily, but *DO NOT* use it for anything serious. Its very likely that there are some bugs in the way permissions are interpreted and sent to brwap.

If a program is supported by aisap's internal library, or if the AppImage has provided its own requirement for permissions, aisap-bin will run and sandbox the requested AppImage using the simple syntax:
```
aisap-bin f.appimage
```

It also includes several command line flags:
```
normal options:
  -h, --help        display this help menu
  -l, --list-perms  list permissions to be granted to the app

long-only options:
  --color    whether color should be shown (default: true)
  --example  show usage examples
  --file     add file to sandbox
  --socket   allow access to additional sockets
  --device   allow access to additional /dev files
  --rmfile   remove file from sandbox
  --rmsocket remove sandbox access to socket
  --rmdevice remove access to device file
  --level    change the base security level of the sandbox (min: 0, max: 3)
  --profile  look for permissions in this entry instead of the AppImage
  --version  print the version and exit
```

## Sandboxing levels
Sandboxing levels allow for a base configuration of system files to grant by default. For AppImages that lack an internal profile with aisap, the default is for aisap-bin is 3 (which will likely cause the app not to work at all, so it is reccomended to launch using the command line flags to grant access to required permissions or to create a profile).

`Level 0` lacks sandboxing entirely, it does the exact same thing as simply lunching the AppImage directly

`Level 1` is the most lenient sandbox, it gives access to almost all system and device files but still restricts home files

`Level 2` is intended to be the target for most GUI apps when creating a profile. It gives access to common system files like fonts and themes, restricts device files and home files

`Level 3` is the most strict. It only grants access to very basic system files (binaries and libraries). It should mainly be used for console applications but some select GUI apps (namely games) that include fonts may work with level 3

## API:
### NewAppImage
```go
NewAppImage(src string) (*AppImage, error)
```
Re-implementation from go-appimage. The main differences being that this mounts the AppImage instead of extracting its files (because it needs to be mounted in order to sandbox anyway)

### Unmount
```go
Unmount(ai *AppImage) error
```
Unmount (shockingly) unmounts the requested AppImage. Note that this is an AppImage struct, which is created by the `NewAppImage()` function. This function needs to be used before using `os.Exit()` or /tmp will be trashed with mounted AppImages

### Run
```go
Run(ai *AppImage, args []string) error
```
Run executes the AppImage without any sandboxing. However, it still automatically creates a private home directory for the AppImage

### Sandbox
```go
Sandbox(ai *AppImage, args []string) error
```
Sandbox takes an AppImage and sandboxes it using the permissions offered.

### GetWrapArgs
```go
GetWrapArgs(ai *AppImage) []string
```
GetWrapArgs takes aisap permissions and translates them into bwrap command line flags. This can be used on its own to see what an AppImage *would* launch with, or to manually launch it

### (AppImage) ExtractFile
```go
(ai AppImage) ExtractFile(path string, dest string, resolveSymlinks bool) error
```
Extract a file from the AppImage to `dest`. If `resolveSymlinks` is set to false, the raw symlink will be extracted instead of its target

### (AppImage) ExtractFileReader
```go
(ai AppImage) ExtractFileReader(path string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
```
Return a reader of the requested file

### (AppImage) Thumbnail
```go
(ai AppImage) Thumbnail() (io.Reader, error)
```
Attempts to extract a thumbnail from the AppImage if available. If provided in a format other than PNG (eg: SVG, XPM) it attempts to convert it to PNG before serving

### (AppImage) Type
```go
(ai AppImage) Type() int
```
Return the type of AppImage. Only supports type 2 currently

### (AppImage) TempDir
```go
(ai AppImage) TempDir() string
```
Returns the AppImage's temporary directory. By default, it will be `/tmp/aisap/...`

### (AppImage) MountDir
```go
(ai AppImage) MountDir() string
```
Returns the AppImage's mountpoint. With aisap, all AppImage structs will be mounted on creation

### (AppImage) AddFile
```go
(ai AppImage) AddFile(str string)
```
Add a single file or directory to the sandbox, appending `:rw` to the filename will give it write access. To prevent writing to the file or directory, either append nothing or `:ro`. Example: `ai.AddFile("xdg-download:rw")`

### (AppImage) AddFiles
```go
(ai AppImage) AddFiles(s []string)
```
Like `AddFile()` but operates on a list of files or directories

### (AppImage) AddDevice
```go
(ai AppImage) AddDevice(s string)
```
Give the sandbox access to a device file (eg: `dri`, `input`). Specifying the full path (eg: `/dev/dri`) is not necessary and advised against

### (AppImage) AddDevices
```go
(ai AppImage) AddDevices(s []string)
```
Allow the sandbox to access more device files (eg: dri, input)

### (AppImage) AddSockets
```go
(ai AppImage) AddSockets(s []string)
```
Share sockets with the sandbox (eg: x11, pulseaudio)

### (AppImage) SetPerms
```go
(ai AppImage) SetPerms(entryFile string) error
```
Set permissions for an AppImage using a desktop entry containing permissions flags

### (AppImage) SetRootDir
```go
(ai AppImage) SetRootDir(d string)
```
Change the directoy that the sandbox grabs system files from. This is useful if you want to hide your real system files or utilize another Linux distro's libraries for compatibility

### (AppImage) SetDataDir
```go
(ai AppImage) SetDataDir(d string)
```
Change the `HOME` directory of the AppImage. By default, this is `[APPIMAGE NAME].home` in the same directory

### (AppImage) SetLevel
```go
(ai AppImage) SetLevel(l int)
```
Change the sandbox's base level
