# Example permission profile for graphical, networked applications like a web
# browser. The intention of this is to be able to customize permissions on the
# go, along with allowing AppImages to embed the permissions they require into
# their main desktop entry.

# `Level` is required, all of the other flags are optional (but will likely be
# needed to make the program run correctly)

# The `Required Permissions` section is NECESSARY!
