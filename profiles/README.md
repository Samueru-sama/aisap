# aisap profiles
A list of common AppImage permission profiles that can be called from external
Go libraries

All items in this list are based on the name of their appropriate AppImage's
desktop entry, as some of the same apps may have different names depending on
the version, there is also a list of aliases that link to the original profile

## Current supported apps: 81
To check whether or not a specific app is supported, either try listing its
permissions with the aisap CLI tool (eg: `aisap myApp.AppImage -l`) or check if
it's listed in the `profiles.go` source file
