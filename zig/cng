Go:
aisap CLI:
 * add `--trust` and `--trust-once` flags to reflect on the new methods to `appimage.go`
 * now only run applications that are marked trusted

aisap.h:
 * change all string types to `const char*`, which is what they should have been already
 * rename `aisap_AppImage` to `aisap_appimage` to make it more coherent with the function naming

appimage.go:
 * add `Trusted` and `SetTrusted` methods, to identify and change an AppImage's trust level

getperms.go:
 * now accept `DataDir` from desktop entry, comment on deprecating `NoDataDir`

wrap.go:
 * remove `PREFER_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES` as it complexified the codebase and never really worked anyway


Zig:
build.zig (example):
 * use the SDK function from `squashfuse-zig` instead of manually linking C files

main.zig (example):
 * remove all old squashfuse code as it has been moved to the `squashfuse-zig` repo
 * remove fuse binding
 * use iterator instead of walker to find desktop file as it is always at the root directory

appimage.zig:
 * remove some bad practice `undefined` default values
 * make all permissions besides `level` optional
 * change socket values from `[]const []const u8` to an enum
 * remove some crappy test code
 * make `appimage.desktop_entry` null terminated
